            <p> Hi everyone I am Ambikesh Srivastava, I study in Prayagraj and this is story from my college life...... 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                It was supposed to be the time of my life. I was finally a college student, away from my parents, free to do whatever I pleased. But as it turned out, being a student was nothing like I had imagined it to be.
                <br>
                
                <br>
                It all began on my first night in the hostel room. I heard strange noises coming from the walls. It was as if someone was scratching on the walls, trying to get in. I tried to ignore it and go to sleep, but I couldn't shake off the fuzzy feeling that someone or something was in the room with me.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the weeks went by, things only got worse. My grades started to slip and I found myself constantly feeling scared and depressed. I would hear footsteps in the hallway when no one was there, and my belongings started going missing.
                <br>
                <br>
                One day, I was studying in the library when I saw a figure in the corner of my eye. It was a girl dressed in all white, with long hair that covered her face. I tried to ignore her, but she kept staring at me with an expressionless face. I decided to leave, but as I walked out, I felt someone grab my arm. It was the girl in white, and her face was now twisted into an evil smile.
                <br>
                <br>
                From that point on, things escalated quickly. I would see her everywhere I went, and the scratching on the walls in my room became louder and more persistent. It was as if she was trying to break through the walls and into my room.
                <br>
                <br>
                One night, I woke up to find her standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me with that same evil grin. She started moving closer and closer, until I could feel her breath on my face. I tried to scream, but my voice seemed to have left me.
                <br>
                <br>
                That was the last thing I remembered before waking up. My friends told me that I had been slept in library, and then I quickly packed bag and I return to my Hometown. I never saw that girl again but I tell this to my mom, she said to change the hostel room or either I try a PG. I came to college and start a new journey but sometimes I felt there is something behind me……………
