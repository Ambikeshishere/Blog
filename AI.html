                Hi there, I am Ambikesh Srivastava. Currently I doing B.Tech and I listen and read from many sources that A.I. increase the rate of Unemployment. In this blog I give you the exact answer of that question. First I give you the answer and the answer is No, A.I. can't increase the rate of unemployment for skilled people but for labour class it may be increase the rate of unemployment. 
                <br><br>

                First I want to talk about Skilled People   <br><br>
                
                If you are skilled and want a desk job. Then congrats you have a lot of oppurtunities in future because A.I. is software program that may be hacked so Cyber Security Jobs Increases alot. A.I. work on Programs so coder is must be required and we all know that an A.I. is can't handle by one human then the company needs much more engineer. A question arise, What if, If the program of A.I. is perfect then the company fired all his engineers. I give the answer A.I. is based on data and codes if the company fired his engineers then the company can't able to update there product because the A.I. Work on old data and after sometime the company will shut down, So If Engineers Fired then Company will be shut down. A.I. is very complex  so you have too much skilled. Other Job oppurtunities is Super vision Some Times A.I. machine make mistakes which is logically correct but practically wrong so you have another job oppurtunities.  <br><br>
                So The conclusion is A.I. can't eat your job but it may hard the competition. But Don't worry not every company hired ever perfect engineers If you  are Average Then you also have  an Oppurtunity.
                
                <br><br>
                And Let's Talk About the labour class  <br><br>
                
                In the era of 2022, I think there are few people who were not able to skilled. An A.I. can't build your home and you don't have money to purchase a machine for building your personal home. But the labour jobs in factories, in buildings, in restraunt, in hotels may be decreases but as I say before A.I. need supervision and security so not even a big hotels and restraunt only believe on there robots. So I think that it deacreases the labour work not the job. For Example Before the Invention of vaccum cleaner our maid/servant clean our home with broom but in now day they used vaccum cleaner but they have there jobs with less efforts they don't lose there but they do there work much easier than before.  <br><br>
                
                
                
                
                
                What if, If A.I. is so perfect?  <br><br>
                
                First thing, nothing is perfect. Now I give you an example. You know Anthony Edward Stark A.K.A Toni Stark (Iron man) he had few A.I. but J.A.R.V.I.S is so intelligent and smart even then J.A.R.V.I.S make mistakes If you watched Iron man 3. J.A.R.V.I.S is smart but Toni Needs more smarter A.I then he create Ultron. The Point If A.I. make so perfect then our needs also Increases and we want much more smarter than older version. So A.I. can't make you Unemployed but it make work much easier than now.  <br><br>
